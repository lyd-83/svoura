    <h1>Since you made it this far!</h1>
    <p>Well, my friend, since you made it this far, it's obvious that you don't have to contact me, but a shelter!<br>
      Please, find a shelter, make a visit and I'm sure you will find another dog (me I already have a home!).<br>
      I can assure you that taking him/her home will be the start of an endless friendship!</p>
