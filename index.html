      <h2>How it all started</h2>
      <p>I was wandering on the streets. People was kicking me around and other dogs weren't always friendly with me.<br>There were days that I couldn't find anything to eat,
        anything at all.<br>Then, one day, I don't really remember how it all happened, maybe I was walking nearby or maybe someone just found me, things are kinda fuzzy.<br>
        Still, the point is that now suddenly I was in a shelter...</p>
    <div id="Shelter days">
      <h3>In the shelter, in the city</h3>
      <p>I can't deny that people in the shelter were nice, but when I got there, I had a peculiar feeling something was changing.<br>Was it the trees around me? Was it the fact that
        we were all with a leash (I hate leashes!) or separated one from the other in several ways?<br>Well, my friends, it was all that together and nothing at all, since it was me the one who was changing.<br>You know, I had a flink once with a beatiful dog, although now that I was pregnant I had to admit the fact that it wasn't just a flink. Anyway!<br>
        As you can see, my little ones had came out to the world and already had been asked from many homes.<br>What about me? Their mummy who was about to lose them soon? Strange thing, nobody was asking for me to take me
        home...</p>
