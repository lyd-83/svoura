      <h2>How it all started</h2>
      <p>I was wandering on the streets. People was kicking me around and other dogs weren't always friendly with me. There were days that I couldn't find anything to eat,
        anything at all. Then, one day, I don't really remember how it all happened, maybe I was walking near there or maybe someone found, things are kinda fuzzy, but
        the point is that now suddenly I was in a shelter.
