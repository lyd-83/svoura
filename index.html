            <p>I was lying around the streets. People kicked me and the other dogs weren't always friendly with me.
                There were days when I couldn't find anything to eat, nothing at all.
                Then, one day, I don't really remember how it all happened, I might walk around or somebody found me, 
                my memory is a little bit blurry. However, the point is that I suddenly found myself in the shelter.</p>

                In the shelter, in the city

            <p>I cannot deny that the people in the shelter were friendly, but when I got there,
                I had a strange feeling that some shocking change had happened to me. Was it the trees around me? 
                The fact that we all had to be tied up somewhere (and I hate leashes!) or in a cage for our own safety and that of others? 
                Was it that while we were close together, at the same time we were far away? My friends, I think these were all and none of them, 
                because I have to confess that I once had a flirtation with a dog. Okay, not exactly flirting, maybe even more,
                because when I was in the shelter, I was already pregnant. And the strangest of all?
                Many people were interested in adopting my beautiful puppies, but nobody wanted to take me home...</p>
